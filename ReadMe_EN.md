# 🧠 OntoTransformer

**OntoTransformer** is an artificial intelligence model designed to interpret product descriptions and convert them into structured representations based on the OntoIMM framework (Ontology-based Intelligent Master Model).

It leverages Transformer-based neural networks to understand natural language and automatically extract:

* 📌 What the product is (*Know-What*)
* 🎯 What the product is for (*Know-Why*)
* 🛠️ How the product is used or assembled (*Know-How*)

### 💡 Use Cases

* Advanced semantic classification in e-commerce
* Automated generation of OWL/JSON-LD ontologies
* Product reasoning in expert systems
* Enrichment of SKOS or hierarchical taxonomies

### 🛠️ Suggested Technologies

* HuggingFace `transformers`
* `spaCy` for NER and parsing
* `rdflib` or `OWLready2` for ontology export
* Supervised training with OntoIMM-style annotations
